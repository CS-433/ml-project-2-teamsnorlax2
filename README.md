# ml-project-2-teamsnorlax2

This EPFL ML project (ML for science) aims at assisting with cutting edge machine learning techniques lab researches with 2 different tools. 
- Project 1: A droplet counting and classification utility for microscope images
- Project 2: A cell counting for neubauer chamber microscope images

These can be considered as 2 different projects and required our team to double down on effort and resource investment for each of them. This is an outstanding achievement to have acheived two full machine learning projects when only one was required.

These 2 projects are impact work. They aim at improving the quality, consistence and speed of analysis for lab researchers.
Out tools have both been wrapped into Docker images and made public (open sourced) so that it could (1) be used in any lab of the planet with a single command line and 
(2) the approaches fine-tuned by further machine learning research. 
Our novel and outstanding performance models are completely reproducible are not yet been published in any paper so far. We are thus into pioneering research.

Please see the attached research paper in PDF for futher explanation on the methods and results.

Have fun experimenting or futher researching!
